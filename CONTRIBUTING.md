# CONTRIBUTING

Standard GitHub procedure applies.  Make a fork and submit a PR.  

If there's a feature you would like, feel free to write an issue for it.

All code must have accompanying unit tests and documentation changes.  

You can execute `make test` to run the tests (this will also check pep8 compliance.)
